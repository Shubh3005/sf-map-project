## üéØ Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How do you ensure solutions work?**
A: Every recommendation includes case studies from similar cities. We cite specific outcomes (e.g., "Compton placed 800+ residents, reduced unemployment 3.5%").

**Q: What's the AI component?**
A: RAG system matches city problems to proven policies, trained on municipal policy documents and outcomes. Goal training personalizes recommendations.

A: 1) Grant applications require detailed plans‚Äîwe provide them. 2) City councils demand ROI‚Äîwe show proof. 3) Staff is overwhelmed‚Äîwe save 100+ hours per report.

**Q: What's your moat?**
A: 1) Curated policy database with outcomes. 2) Training system learns city priorities. 3) Relationships with data providers. 4) Network effects as more cities use it.
